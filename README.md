## 🎯 Gameplay Concept

Inspired by *Papers, Please*, the player acts as a **study advisor**, assisting fictional students who walk into their office seeking guidance.

### 🕹️ Gameplay Loop:
1. A prospective student arrives.
2. The player reads their **biography**, inspects **items**, and asks **questions**.
3. Based on clues, the player chooses a suitable **bachelor program flyer** to hand out.
4. At the end of each level (3 characters), the player is rated with **gold, silver, or bronze stars**, based on the fit of their recommendations.

The final levels prompt **personal reflection**, encouraging players to choose a study for themselves—bridging the gap between fiction and reality.
